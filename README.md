# React App Test - Employee Management

Welcome to the React App Test repository! This is a test project where you can clone the repository and attempt to complete the tasks related to an employee management system. The main objectives of this test are:

1. Add a New Employee: Implement the functionality to add a new employee to the list with input validation for all required fields.
2. Edit Employee Salary: Enable editing of an employee's salary and ensure proper validation before saving the changes.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Repository: First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url.git>
```

2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the cloned project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
cd react-app-test
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server to view and work on the app:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

4. Open in the Browser: The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your web browser to access the app.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add a New Employee

In the application, you'll find a form to add a new employee. The form should contain the following input fields:

-   Employee Name (required)
-   Employee Position (required)
-   Employee Salary (required, numeric value greater than zero)

The "Add Employee" button should be disabled until all the input fields are valid. Invalid input fields should be indicated with appropriate error messages.

### Task 2: Edit Employee Salary

When you click on an employee's salary, it should turn into an editable field. You can edit the salary value, and a "Save" button will appear next to the salary field.

The "Save" button should be disabled until a valid salary value is entered. The salary value should be a numeric value greater than zero.
